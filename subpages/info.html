                <p>This is a lookup tool that allows anyone to see if a person has been previously reported as a scammer at a trusted server. It is made by a single person who one day decided to instead of just reporting scammers to the server they used to contact them through, to instead log that users information for later use. Now this database gathers information from chosen servers and hosts an ever growing collection of users to be weary off if they decide to offer their services.</p>

                <h2 class="text-center py-2">What are the goals?</h2>
                <p>The end goal of this tool is to provide a service for regular users and server owners/admins to be save on Discord. Ideally we would have an extensive database of scammers and ways of alerting and warning server owners and admins live when a user that is in or has joined their server may not be there to hang out and chat but to harm their community by scamming its members.</p>

                <h2 class="text-center py-2">How can i help?</h2>
                <p>You can help in 2 ways by providing data (we gather usernames, displaynames, IDs, and transcripts) if you are an owner/admin of a server with large traffic of scammers or by helping the development of the database by offering knowledge or the means to improve how the database functions. In both cases you can find a discord server invite attached below. Once you are in the server open a ticket and i will get to you as soon as I am available.</p>
