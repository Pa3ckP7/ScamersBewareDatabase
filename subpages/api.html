                <p>Due to limitation imposed by github pages there is no proper api to call upon, but we can simulate that with some json thomfoolery. The databse currently exists as a collection of json files stored in the data directory of the website. To get the info about a user we simply have to navigate said directory. If the user is found you get a return if not you get a 404. Not the best solution, but it's the best solution i could come up with without having to host a server. If you have a better idea feel free to contact me, my information is found in the info tab.</p>

                <h2 class="text-center py-2">Looking up users</h2>
                <p>Currently there are 2 ways to lookup if a user is a scammer. Both require the users ID. The 1st way is to call upon the all file of the data directory and look through it yourself. Alternatively each entry has their own json file named with the users ID which has more ingotmation about the user, such as their known usernames and display names, when they were recorded by the database, and where they were spotted. Below some examples can be found.</p>
