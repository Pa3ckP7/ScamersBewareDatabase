What do you think?\r\nPa3ckP7 — Today at 01:25\r\nVery interesting, but i normally go with functional pieces, although that sounds very cool i don't see the functionality of it\r\nDezmo The Husky — Today at 01:27\r\nAlright do have any requirements?\r\nPa3ckP7 — Today at 01:29\r\nI don't understand what you mean by requirements. It's as simple as i commission when i need something. A full body piece does not exactly server a function as such i am not interested\r\nDezmo The Husky — Today at 01:30\r\nSo you are not interested?\r\nPa3ckP7 — Today at 01:30\r\nNope art just for the purpose of having it is not my thing"
