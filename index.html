                <h2 class="text-center py-2">User Lookup</h2>
                <p>Have you been contacted by a random person through a mutual server? Head over to the lookup tab where
                    you
                    can enter their User ID and check if they are a scammer. Fair warning if the user is not found in
                    the
                    database that does not mean that they are legit, neither does it mean that they are 100% a scammer
                    if
                    they are found in the database. If a user is found in the database it just means that their
                    behavious
                    pattern in dms was noted as suspicious and recorded by a partnered server.</p>

                <h2 class="text-center py-2">Partnered Servers</h2>
                <p>No these are not the ones partnered with discord. Due to the limits on how the database is currently
                    hosted and the potential of nefarious actors abusing the database. Entries are only provided by
                    trusted
                    servers, which have a high rate of art scammers. These we call partnered servers</p>
                <p>If your server has a large volume of scammers head over to the info tab to learn more about the
                    project
                    and how you can apply to have the scammers you catch added to the database</p>
